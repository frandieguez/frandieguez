### Hi there 👋
Hi! I'm ✨ Fran Diéguez ✨ and I've been developing web applications as a 
Full Stack Developer since 2006. 

I've been in multiple positions thoughtout my career, from a software developer, lead developer, 
CTO, and Head of Research and Development. 
The objective on each project is to create useful tools that make 
impact on users.


- 🔭 I’m currently working on ...

Currently I'm helping to create the visual part of [Situm](https://www.situm.com), 
an awesome company that helps multiple industries to position their users 
(robots and people) indoors while doing Bussiness Intelligence on gathered data.

Before I've being proudly creating different tools focused on high performance 
and heavy loaded systems that helped journalists to maintain online newspapers, developing [OpenNemas](https://www.opennemas.com).

Prior that I've been working as a open-source software consultant at the 
University of Santiago de Compostela, where I've developed a custom Linux-based 
desktop in order to simplify administrative tasks and also doing massive 
migrations to open source sofware in educational settings. 
This project won the Libre Software contest in Galicia, Spain.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...

From the technical perspective my main focus is web performance, sustainable engineering and open source technology.
But lately I've been focused on Frontend Web Development

Whenever not thinking on web development, I can be found contributing to
open-source projects 👨‍💻 like GNOME (as a member of the GNOME Foundation)

reading or doing sports like Crossfit and snowboard 🏂.
